## newly added (user recommends)
 - collect all post captions
 
## How to run? 

## STEP 1:
   - just open auth.py & place your username and password
   - run the Ibot.py to get your current session id
    
    `python Ibot.py`

## STEP 2:
   - once you get a session id, run the main file and follow the instructions
    
    `python main.py`
   
## you can install package with npm too

    npm i instagram-scraper-it



## About Session ID activity:
- it will stay for more than 5 days for active use, 
      after some days session id will be re-generated by Instagram.
      so, you need to get a new session id help of Ibot.py
- no worry about session id anymore due to Ibot.py

|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **JSON decode error**             | maybe the session id is expired, simply go to your Instagram id and pick up a new session id |
| **too many requests**             | just try after a few mins or after some hours                                                |


## COMMON - you need to be aware of Instagram [my opinion]
     - if your main profile URL gets blocked, just leave it for 24 or 48 hours
     - suppose you make 20 requests, just give some hours gaps
     - inbox, main page - don't get blocked 
     - don't ever give plenty of requests like 100, Instagram thinks you like a spam bot
     - they collect a device id and Infos to figure out what we're doing all the time
     - Instagram is tricky API - give false information too -  ex: users: [], status: 'ok'
     - suppose if instagram makes your account blocked too, just follow the instructions to solve the problem of your signin :)
