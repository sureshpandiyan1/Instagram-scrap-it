##  FAQ
     How to scrap a data without loss your own insta account ?
     highly request you to use a well-qualified vpn & create a fake accounts to scrap a information
     
     why my session id is expired ?
     instagram session id is not a static one, it will change very randomly
     
     can i hack a instagram account using instagram-scraper-it ?
     Sorry, those types of things not exists in instagram-scraper-it. just for scrap a data only !!
     
     how instagram banned particular account due to scrap the data?
     first, they will identify how many requests comes from your ip address, if there is too many requests, it's really look like a bot.
     just use a fake insta accounts..
     


## COMMON - you need to be aware of Instagram [my opinion]
     - if your main profile URL gets blocked, just leave it for 24 or 48 hours
     - dont ever  use instagram-scraper-it more than 5 times a days,
     - suppose you make 20 requests, just give some hours gaps
     - inbox, main page - don't get blocked 
     - don't ever give plenty of requests like 100, Instagram thinks you like a spam bot
     - they collect a device id and Infos to figure out what we're doing all the time
     - Instagram is tricky API - give false information too -  ex: users: [], status: 'ok'
     - suppose if instagram makes your account blocked too, just follow the instructions to solve the problem of your signin :)
     - whatever your instagram account get blocked also, you can unblock it due to following instruction of instagram
